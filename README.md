[![FOSSA Status](https://app.fossa.com/api/projects/git%2Bgithub.com%2Fxnzz%2Frepolinter.svg?type=shield)](https://app.fossa.com/projects/git%2Bgithub.com%2Fxnzz%2Frepolinter?ref=badge_shield)

Lint open source repositories for common issues.

## Usage

To run against a directory, add it to the command line `npx repolinter /my/code/dir`.

To run against a git repository, use the `--git` option: `npx repolinter --git https://my.git.code/awesome`.

Note, if you are running a version of npm < 5.2.0, run `npm install npx` first.

You can also run Repo Linter locally by cloning this repository and running `bin/repolinter.js` with either a directory of a git repository the same as above. This is useful during development.

## Examples

To quickly get started, checkout this repository and run `npx repolinter` against itself.

```
git clone https://github.com/todogroup/repolinter
npx repolinter

```

## Command line dependencies

You will need to have Node, Ruby/Ruby-Dev, and Bundle installed in order to use repolinter. If you are installing on OS X, you will also likely need to install RVM.

The npm log-symbols package must be installed to run `repolinter`.
```
npm install log-symbols
```
Repolinter will use https://github.com/benbalter/licensee and https://github.com/github/linguist when installed.

Licensee will lead to a test being done to see if the project's licensee is identified by Licensee. Version 9.9.0 or later is needed, older versions will probably cause errors.

Linguist allows per-language tests to be performed.

Run `bundle install` to get Licensee and Linguist support.

## Custom Result Formatter
By default, results will be shown as in the example format above.

When using `repolinter` in another project, you can set `resultFormatter` to a custom formatter. Any custom formatter needs to have a `format` function that takes a single [Result](./lib/result.js) argument, and returns a string.

## Default ruleset
The default ruleset (```rulesets/default.json```) defines a set of common patterns against certain rules.  i.e., the `license-file-exists` and `readme-file-exists` default rules both trigger a `file-exists` test but against different file patterns.

All languages:
* [license-file-exists](#license-file-exists)
* [readme-file-exists](#readme-file-exists)
* [contributing-file-exists](#contributing-file-exists)
* [code-of-conduct-file-exists](#code-of-conduct-file-exists)
* [changelog-file-exists](#changelog-file-exists)
* [support-file-exists](#support-file-exists)
* [readme-references-license](#readme-references-license)
* [binaries-not-present](#binaries-not-present)
* [license-detectable-by-licensee](#license-detectable-by-licensee)
* [test-directory-exists](#test-directory-exists)
* [integrates-with-ci](#integrates-with-ci)
* [source-license-headers-exist](#source-license-headers-exist)

## Configuring rules

Currently you need to create a new ruleset to add, remove, or configure rules. We'll be adding the ability to inherit from an existing ruleset to simplify this in the future.

### Overriding the ruleset globally or for a project
To override the default ruleset copy ```rulesets/default.json``` to ```repolint.json``` (or ```repolinter.json```) in the target directory, any ancestor directory of the target directory, or your user directory.

### Disabling rules
To disable a rule change it's value to ```false```, for example:
```
{
  "rules": {
    "all": {
      "license-file-exists:file-existence": false
    }
  }
}
```

### Changing a rule's level
To change the level when a rule returns a failure change the first argument of the rule to ```error```, ```warning```, or ```info```, for example:
```
{
  "rules": {
    "all": {
      "license-detectable-by-licensee": ["info"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Configuring a rule's options
To configure a rule's options change the second argument of the rule to an object specifying the rule's options, see [rules](#rules) for details about each rule's options. For example:
```
{
  "rules": {
    "all": {
      "source-license-headers-exist:file-starts-with": ["warning", {"files": ["**/*.java"], "lineCount": 2, "patterns": ["Copyright", "All rights reserved", "Licensed under"]}]
    }
  }
}
```

### Axioms: Running rules only in certain situations
Rules can be configured to only run if the repository passes a particular test or 'axiom'.

Axioms are defined in an axiom block in the ruleset. For example:

```
  "axioms": {
    "linguist":"language",
    "licensee":"license"
  }
```

This will run both the linguist and licensee axioms and put their output into 'language' and 'license' respectively.

The axioms are then tied to rules. For example, the following rule will only run when the linguist axiom has put the value 'java' into the language value:

```
    "language=java": {
      "package-metadata-exists:file-existence": ["error", {"files": ["pom.xml", "build.xml", "build.gradle"]}]
    }
```

You can also match any response by using a '\*'; however note that currently there is no wildcard matching, ie: you couldn't match 'j*' to get both java and javascript.

There are currently three axioms defined:

#### Linguist
Languages are detected using Linguist which must be in your path, see [command line dependencies](#command-line-dependencies) for details.

#### Licensee
Licenses are detected using Licensee which must be in your path, see [command line dependencies](#command-line-dependencies) for details.

#### Packagers
Package systems (for example Maven, NPM and PyPI) are detected by looking for certain common filenames. See the axioms/packagers.js file for the full mapping.

## Rules

The rules system is made up of rule types which can be customized to fit your needs.

### directory-existence
Fails if none of the directories specified in the ```directories``` option exist. Pass in a ```fail-message``` option to further explain why the directory should exist to the user. Pass in ```"nocase": true``` in the options for a case-insensitive search.

### file-contents
Fails if the content of any of the files specified in the ```files``` option doesn't match the regular expression specified in the ```content``` option. If the content is a regular expression or some other non-human-readable string, include the ```human-readable-content``` option with human-readable output. By default, no output is returned if no file exists given the inputs. Use the ```fail-on-non-existent``` option to return a failure.

### file-existence
Fails if none of the files specified in the ```files``` option exist. Pass in a ```fail-message``` option to further explain why the file should exist to the user. Pass in ```"nocase": true``` in the options for a case-insensitive search.

### file-hash
Fails if the content of file specified in the ```file``` option does not hash to the hex value in the ```hash``` option.  The default algorithm is ```sha256``` and can be changed in the ```algorithm``` option. Use the ```succeed-on-non-existent``` option if a missing file is acceptable, otherwise a missing file produces a failure.

### file-not-contents
The opposite of ```file-contents```. By default, no output is returned if no file exists given the inputs. Use the ```succeed-on-non-existent``` option to return a success result.

### file-starts-with
Produces a failure for each file matching the ```files``` option if the first ```lineCount``` lines don't match all of the regular expressions specified in the ```patterns``` option. Set the ```skip-binary-files``` option to skip files that aren't text. By default, no output is returned if no file exists given the inputs. In that case, use the ```succeed-on-non-existent``` option to return a success result. Certain files can be omitted from being checked by using the ```skip-paths-matching``` option as an object with `extensions` and `patterns` array members.

### file-type-exclusion
Fails if any files match the ```type``` option.

### git-grep-commits
Searches Git commits for configurable blacklisted words. These
words can in fact be extended regular expressions. These checks can be
a bit time consuming, depending on the size of the Git history.

### git-grep-log
Searches Git commit messages for configurable blacklisted words. These
words can in fact be extended regular expressions. These checks can be
a bit time consuming, depending on the size of the Git history.

### git-list-tree
Check for blacklisted paths in Git.

### git-working-tree
Checks whether the directory is managed with Git.

### license-detectable-by-licensee
Fails if Licensee doesn't detect the repository's license.

This rule requires ```licensee``` in the path, see [command line dependencies](#command-line-dependencies) for details.

## Implementing Rules

Rules are written in JavaScript (see the rules/ directory for examples). A rule can also be written in JSON as a 'rule set' (i.e. a configuraton of rules) allowing rules to be composed from smaller items. The rules/apache-notice.json is an example of a rule implemented in JSON.
